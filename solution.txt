first created a directory called evidence to collet
all the the found evidences

head -n 20 people
to print the first 20 line

cat crimescene | grep CLUE
to print all lines that contains CLUE word inside of it

cat vehicles | grep Annabel
to print all the lines that contains Annabel

cat people | grep Oluwasegun\ Annabel
to see where she lives

head -n 173 streets/Mattapan_Street | tail -n 1
this command will print only the list line

grep -A 5 "L337" vehicles
this will print all vehicles that has a number plate start with L337

we're looking for blue Honda with license plate start with L337

the good solution to find that easily with out seeing all the cars is
by cat all the results to another file .
to do that use the following command

grep -A 5 "L337" vehicles >> evidence/carplates.txt

to find the blue Honda
grep -A 5 "Honda" carplates.txt

we can make it more easier by
grep -A 5 "Honda" carplates.txt >> blue-Honda.txt

now by command grep -A 5 "Blue" blue-honda.txt
we will see all people who has blue Honda


by using cat AAA Delta_SkyMiles library.txt | grep -c "any name"
  we can see the matches character in all mentioned files

we can try that command with all people we found previously in
  blue-honda.txt and start investigation again

  the suspect is Jeremy Bowers
